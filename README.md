# **DEPTH INFORMATION ESTIMATION**
> Stereo Matching is one of the fundamentals regarding the field of Computer Vision, which aims to reconstruct 3D real world objects from 2D images captured from stereo cameras. Stereo Matching is mostly applied in Autonomous Driving, Augmented Reality and other vital missions. In this project, we will resolve some basic problems and algorithms of Stereo Matching.

## Installation
1. Clone the repositiory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/khenm/depth_information_estimation.git
cd depth_information_estimation # or folder name storing the git
```
2. Install dependenicies:
If you run this file in VSCode, please follow the instructions in the file.
Otherwise, you need to change some of the functions to show images.
As Google Colab does not support cv2.imshow(), please do changes as instructed:
```bash
from google.colab.patches import cv2_imshow
```

 ## Usage
If you want to briefly grasp the program, run `.ipynb` file in the folder. 
After that, for other test samples, you can change the path to the image to achieve different results.
